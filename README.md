🍁 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a healthcare-focused Machine Learning project that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, and age.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline:

📥 Data loading

🧼 Data cleaning (handling invalid medical values)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

📊 Feature scaling

✂️ Train-test split

🧪 Logistic Regression

🌲 Random Forest (tuned)

📉 Confusion matrix + classification report

🗂️ Dataset

Public diabetes dataset (PIMA Indians Diabetes Database):
👉 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Google Colab

📈 Model Performance

Logistic Regression: ~75% accuracy

Random Forest (tuned): ~75–78% accuracy

🔬 Key Insights

Glucose is the strongest predictor

BMI and Age have moderate correlation

Healthcare ML focuses more on recall and false negatives

A simple model (Logistic Regression) works surprisingly well

🩺 Healthcare Relevance

This model helps identify high-risk diabetes patients early, enabling:

early intervention

diet/lifestyle recommendations

preventive health check-ups
