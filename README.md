# 🍁 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a healthcare-focused Machine Learning project that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on clinical features such as **glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, and age**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline:

- 📥 Data loading  
- 🧼 Data cleaning (handling invalid medical values)  
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis  
- 📊 Feature scaling  
- ✂️ Train-test split  
- 🧪 Logistic Regression  
- 🌲 Random Forest (tuned)  
- 📉 Confusion matrix + classification report  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

Public diabetes dataset (PIMA Indians Diabetes Database):  
👉 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Google Colab  

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Logistic Regression:** ~75% accuracy  
- **Random Forest (tuned):** ~75–78% accuracy  

---

## 🔬 Key Insights

- **Glucose** is the strongest predictor of diabetes  
- **BMI** and **Age** show moderate correlation with diabetes  
- Healthcare ML prioritizes **recall** to reduce false negatives  
- Simpler models can outperform complex models on smaller clinical datasets  

---

## 🩺 Healthcare Relevance

This model helps identify **high-risk diabetic patients** early, enabling preventive care, timely diagnosis, and early intervention.
